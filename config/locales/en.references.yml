    camel-festival:
      content: For Camel's promotional campaigns on festivals, 3antworten have implemented
        a system to onboard new users to the digital Camel community. The system consists
        of an iPad app, a Mac app and a server side component. The tablet is able
        to store user data offline in an internal database. The tablet app detects
        and rejects duplicates intelligently – even across multiple devices. The Mac
        app can then synchronize all deployed iPads with each other to improve the
        duplication heuristic, save all collected data locally and sync them up to
        the server component whenever the internet connection is available again.
        Finally the head of the campaign is able to review collected data and the
        progress of the event. 3antworten always develop with special attention to
        security. An end-to-end encryption starting with the user's input and ending
        at the server's side was implemented to protect sensitive data.
