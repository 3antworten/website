# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

Besides the fully mobile first and responsive approach a custom content management system was implemented handling miscellaneous assets. 3antworten always tries to handle the client wishes with an agile development process and rapid communication flows."
    liquidsquare: "Liquidsquare is an order management tool for restaurateurs to communicate with their wholesalers. 3antworten bootstraped the prototype for the minimum viable product which is now developed by Liquidsquare UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt). The architecture of the product is fully distributed and scale-out ready and uses state-of-the-art caching technologies providing the best user experience. 3antworten always foregrounds the usability of their applications, so that for the Liquidsquare product UX-experts have been mediated."
    booklapp: "Booklapp is a web application which provides the composition of an app with content coming from one or more PDF assets. 3antworten developed this application and always attaches importance to being production ready for any users withouth technology affinities. Therefore the corresponding App Store ready apps are built by the application and can be easily deployed over the air. 3antworten delivered this application pre-installed on tested hardware."
    bh-taxi: "3antworten has implemented a webapp game for Benson & Hedges. The target platform were desktop and tablet. For the latter, the device's orientation controls the direction of the taxi car, which collects power-ups on the map. The game was produced in the context of Germany's Benson & Hedges consumer platform."
    camel-festival: "For Camel promotion events on festivals 3antworten has implemented a system to collect user data. The system consists of an iPad app, a Mac app and a server side component. Because of the offline requirement the tablet is able to store user data in an internal database, detects and rejects duplicates intelligently. The Mac app can sync up to 12 iPads with each other to improve the duplication heuristic and sync up all collected data to the server component. The promotion client is able to review collected data and can review the progress of the event. 3antworten always develops with special attention to security, so an end-to-end encryption starting at the user's input and ending at the server's side was implemented to protect the sensitive data."
    floodfill: "For Germany's Camel consumer platform 3antworten has developed a webapp game for the platforms smartphone, tablet and desktop. The goal of the game is to color all shapes on the canvas, so that no adjacent shapes have the same pattern. The mobile first and responsive webapp uses modern vector technologies for rapid map prototyping."
