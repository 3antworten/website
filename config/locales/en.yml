    booklapp:
      content: Booklapp is a web application developed by 3antworten. The app allows
        designing a tablet-app with content coming from PDF files. The corresponding
        App Store-ready apps are built by Booklapp and can easily be deployed over

    camel-festival:
      content: For Camel's promotional campaigns on festivals, 3antworten have implemented
        a system to collect user data. The system consists of an iPad app, a Mac app
        and a server side component. The tablet is able to store user data offline
        in an internal database. The tablet app detects and rejects duplicates intelligently.
        The Mac app can then synchronize up to 12 iPads with each other to improve
        the duplication heuristic and sync up all collected data to the server component.
        Finally the head of the campaign is able to review collected data and the
        progress of the event. 3antworten always develop with special attention to
        security. An end-to-endencryption starting with the user's input and ending
        at the server's side was implemented to protect sensitive data.

        technologies for rapid map prototyping.
