    bh-taxi:
      content: 3antworten have realized a web app game for Benson & Hedges. The target
        platforms are tablets and desktop devices. A taxi cab‘s driving direction
        is controlled by keyboard and the tablet‘s orientation, respectively. 3antworten
        always assure a natural and playful gaming experience. The game was produced
        in the context of Germany's Benson & Hedges consumer platform.

    booklapp:
      content: Booklapp is a web application developed by 3antworten. The app allows
        designing a tablet app with content coming from PDF files. These files can
        even be designed for prepress. The corresponding App Store-ready apps are
        built by Booklapp and can easily be deployed over the air. 3antworten always
        care about user-friendliness, even for the ones with little tech know-how!
        3antworten delivered this application pre-installed on tested hardware.

    camel-festival:
      content: For Camel's promotional campaigns on festivals, 3antworten have implemented
        a system to onboard new users to the digital Camel community. The system consists
        of an iPad app, a Mac app and a server side component. The tablet is able
        to store user data offline in an internal database. The tablet app detects
        and rejects duplicates intelligently – even across multiple devices. The Mac
        app can then synchronize all deployed iPads with each other to improve the
        duplication heuristic, save all collected data locally and sync them up to
        the server component whenever the internet connection is available again.
        Finally the head of the campaign is able to review collected data and the
        progress of the event. 3antworten always develop with special attention to
        security. An end-to-end encryption starting with the user's input and ending
        at the server's side was implemented to protect sensitive data.

    floodfill:
      content: For the German Camel consumer platform 3antworten have developed a
        web app game for smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. The goal of the
        game is to color different shapes on a canvas so that no adjacent shapes have
        the same pattern. This mobile first and responsive approach, combined with
        modern vector technologies for rapid map prototyping represents 3antworten's
        development credo.

    liquidsquare:
      content: Liquidsquare is an order management tool for restaurateurs to communicate
        with their wholesalers. 3antworten bootstrapped the prototype for the minimum
        viable product which is now developed by Liquidsquare UG (haftungsbeschränkt).
        The architecture of the product is fully distributed and scale-out ready.
        State-of-the-art caching technologies are being used providing the best possible
        user experience. Because 3antworten always foreground the usability of their
        applications, UX-experts were engaged to work hand in hand with us for the
        Liquidsquare product.

    live-academy:
      content: The live-academy website was designed and implemented entirely by 3antworten.
        Besides the fully mobile first and responsive approach a custom content management
        system was implemented handling miscellaneous assets. 3antworten always try
        to handle the clients' wishes with an agile development process and a swift
        communication flow.
